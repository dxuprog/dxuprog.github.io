		Hello there!
		<br>
		<p>
			This is my personal website where I highlight some great projects I've worked on, great places I've worked, and frameworks I've used. I am currently a software engineer at Ultimate Software who are the makers of UltiPro, a cloud based human capital management solution. I am working with a fast-paced, agile team building a workforce management solution.
		</p>
		<p>
			I studied computer science at the <b>University of Waterloo</b>, in Ontario, Canada, and graduated with a <b>MMath thesis degree in Computer Science</b>. Prior to my Master's degree, I had completed a Bachelor's degree in <b>Biomedical and Electrical Engineering</b> at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. I also have industry experience in software engineering in Ottawa's telecommunications industry.
		</p>
		<p>
			The variety of advanced level computer science classes, as well as the vibrant high-tech community has led me to study at Waterloo. This page highlights my interests, projects and resume. Please feel free to contact me at <b>dxu228 [~AT~] gmail (DOT) com</b>.
