            What we built
          </h4>
          <p>
            I can't say too much about this once because it's internal. But we utilized an array of
            <b>Estimote beacons</b> to determine positions of users inside a room. Data from the beacons were aggregated and
            displayed to a front-end via
            <b>heatmap.js</b>.
          </p>

          </p>
          <h4>
            Takeaways:
          </h4>
          <p>
            The beacons last forever, and they are quite small. They can be hid in various spots and are battery powered. In terms of
            position accuracy they are enough to distinguish someone's position within a couple feet to a beacon.
            <b>Heatmap.js</b> is also a wonderful library that is simple to use. I can see it being used in a lot with maps
            and location data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team took home
            <b>Best Themed Category</b>. The other projects we're all incredibly well done. I am amazed by some of the engineers
            in this company.

            What we built
          </h4>
          <p>
            We built a platform in which users could share their knowledge about Arthritis. What surprised us is that many people afflicted
            with Arthritis have an initial trouble building up a knowledge base about the condition, different treatments,
            products and patient support programs. It didn't make sense to us that this problem should exist in the information
            age.

          </p>
          <p>
            We decided to build a knowledge platform that users could submit and rate products, articles and healthcare professionals.
            Kind of like a Yelp for Arthritis.
          </p>
          With four developers on our team, we hit the ground running trying to push as much features we could. It was ambitious: a
          progressive web app in <b>Vue.js</b>, a back-end powered by <b>Firebase</b>, a voice assistant using <b>Google's DialogFlow</b>, and
          a Chrome extension for seamless integration.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, I put together the Firebase back-end which stored the rating content, as well as handled the back-end calls via
            <b>Google Cloud Functions</b>. I also built the voice assistant.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Takeaways:
          </h4>
          <p>
            We ended up winning the
            <b>People's Choice</b> award, which felt great because it was first time I won a public hackathon. I was introduced
            to Progressive web apps, and what my teammate built in Vue.js was amazing. I think I will look into this concept
            and framework in future projects. It seems capable enough as a "build once" type app, in which it can handle
            web, and mobile at the same time. I also went deeper into the DialogFlow API and Google Cloud Functions. I was
            able to program content-rich responses to Google Assistant, in which voice + a carousel of photo and data was
            shown to the users.

          </h4>
          <p>
            I can't go into the specifics, but we used Google's DialogFlow (API.AI at the time) to build a voice assistant that interacted
            with our product. We had to create an "AI Gateway" built in Node.js which acted as a passthrough for routing
            intents from the Voice Assistant, and translated them into the appropriate server calls. I created a simple <b>AngularJS</b>
            component and leveraged the voice libraries in HTML5 to prototype a in-app voice assistant, in which Google Assistant
            wasn't needed.
          </p>

            Takeaways:
          </h4>
          <p>
            Google's DialogFlow is an amazingly easy to use. It was so natural to build conversation actions, and it had great one-click
            integrations with popular assistant services such as Google Voice Assistant and Alexa. It's truly a weapon at
            hackathons because it doesn't take much time to build one, yet the results are so appealing to the audience because
            of it's novelty.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>We won best overall!</b> This was the first hackathon I've won and it was a great feeling. There was some really
            great competition and projects, given that this was company-wide with over 300 engineers participating.

          <p>
            We built a Native Android app that would generate jogging paths based on where the user is, and the desired duration. On
            top of that we built a modified "Sneaker" companion which had turn signals and break lights controlled by the
            a <b>Myo</b> armband from Thalmic Labs.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Takeaways:
          </h4>
          <p>
            At the time, Thalmic Labs did not have a API available for Linux. This was unfortunate because we wanted to program directly
            on the Raspberry Pi. However, we found an open source version called Myo Raw which let us do that. We encountered
            some bugs, but like any good hackathon, we added hacks to get around them. My most unfortuante hack was writing
            a Unix script to constantly "reboot" connection to the Myo every 10 seconds, because the API would lose signal
            after that. Also, we learned that Princeton is very far from Waterloo.

            FoodBox is a mobile application that tracks perishable foods and notifies users of expiry dates. We used <b>Clarifai deep-learning
            API</b> to identify foods so users can log food with their camera. Users can track their friends perishables through
            the application and collaborate on recipes suggested by the app. I implemented the back-end service powered by
            <b>Firebase</b> as well as integrated the machine learning API to the camera.

          </h4>
          <p>
            Firebase is easy to learn but a little to master. I found that Firebase is perfect for hackathons due to it's free-to-use
            license, and quick start up times. The real-time data integration on Android took a lot work off our plates.
            Machine learning for food identification is viable, but in the end it often requires human validation.

            of Things sensor onto the axe and have it read measurments such as rotations and acceleration. I implemented
            our idea into an Android mobile application by extending the base source code provided by the manufactuer, and
            configured the device to send the measurements we needed
